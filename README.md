# simple-Linear-Regression
Simple linear regression is a powerful tool for understanding the relationship between two variables and making predictions based on that relationship. However, it's important to validate the assumptions of the model and interpret the results carefully to draw meaningful conclusions.

# multiple linear regression
Multiple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between multiple independent variables (predictors) and a single dependent variable (outcome). It extends simple linear regression, which models the relationship between one independent variable and the dependent variable.

 # Polynomial Regression
 
 *Polynomial regression is a powerful technique for modeling non-linear relationships between variables. Unlike simple linear regression, which fits a straight line to the data,     polynomial regression fits a polynomial function.
 
 *In polynomial regression, we model the relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable using a polynomial equation of degree n. The general form of a   polynomial regression equation with one independent variable
