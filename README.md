# simple-Linear-Regression
Simple linear regression is a powerful tool for understanding the relationship between two variables and making predictions based on that relationship. However, it's important to validate the assumptions of the model and interpret the results carefully to draw meaningful conclusions.

#multiple linear regression
Multiple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between multiple independent variables (predictors) and a single dependent variable (outcome). It extends simple linear regression, which models the relationship between one independent variable and the dependent variable.
